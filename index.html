                    <p>
                        Graduated from Kajaani University of Applied Sciences in 12/2022. 
                        The university is specialized in game programming and design. I am a hardworking and constantly learning programmer, aspiring for greatness. 
                        I have broad experience on multiple different types of projects, with a solid grip on teamwork. 
                        Worked on multiple engaging projects during university, in which I took on an extensive programming role.
                        Clear understanding of the code base of previous projects. "The guy" for advice on implementation and problem solving.

                    <p>I have a fiancee, that I've shared lifes hurdles with for 13 years. We've supported each other, and enjoyed life together.</p>
                    <p> We also own three very cute and friendly cats. One of them enjoyed purring into the mic at every morning daily during my term as an UI/UX designer </p>

                    <h4>Hobbies</h4>
                    <p>I have loved videogames since I was tiny. Not a big surprise there. I enjoy trying out different types of games. I love seeing what makes them tick.</p>
                    <p>I enjoy seeing the ideas and visions people had when they made the games. There is a type of soul to most games.</p>

                <div id="Stuff2" class="tab-content">
                    <p>I almost became an Bachelor in Energy engineering. I worked as an engineer during school, and quickly realised I had no passion for it.</p>
                    <p> I wanted to find something I actually want to do for the rest of my life. I took a leap of faith and left for the best place to learn game programming. </p>
                    <p> I wanted to be the guy who makes the impossible possible.</p>

                <div id="Stuff3" class="tab-content">
                    <p>When I create something, I feel great, when I solve the coding problems, I feel amazing. And looking back I know I've done a good job, but still; "Imposter syndrome". 
                    <br>
                        I feel like I just haven't seen a real challenge yet, and I'm actually not good programming, and it affects my motivation to create things on my own.
                    <br>
                     I know there is a truth to that aswell, so I'm hoping I can find a place where I'll be challenged, and encouraged by fellow gamedevs.

                <p>Working on my skillset. Sometimes its hard to find something to focus on, as I'd like to work on something I'll need at my next employment opportunity. </p>
